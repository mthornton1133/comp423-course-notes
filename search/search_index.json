This becomes super important when working in teams. Creating Dev Containers is a way to fix the \u201cIt Doesn\u2019t Work on my Machine\u201d problem. It also simplifies onboarding new people to a project. Docker comes into play by specifying a specific image to set up the development environment. The steps below essentially automate the process of setting up a Dev Container.</p>"},{"location":"tutorials/rust-setup/#step-1-add-dev-container-configurations","title":"Step 1: Add Dev Container Configurations:","text":"<ol> <li>In Visual Studio Code, open the <code>rust-project</code> directory.

In the terminal type the following code: <pre><code>cargo new hello-comp423 --vcs none\ncd hello-comp423\n</code></pre></li> <li>The previous code created our rust project without creating it's VCS and then we switch into this newly created project. Navigate to the <code>src/main.rs</code> file and open it. Change the contents of the <code>println</code> function to say \u201cHello COMP423\u201d. It should look like this: <pre><code>fn main() {\n    println!(\"Hello COMP423\");\n}\n</code></pre></li> <li>To print the contents there are two methods:<ul> <li>Use <code>cargo build</code> in the terminal. This compiles an executable file but does not run it. To run it do <code>./target/debug/hello-comp423</code>. Note this is similar to using C in COMP 211 and running <code>gcc &lt;project-name&gt;</code> and it creates the executable a.out and to run the file you must type <code>./a.out</code>. The <code>cargo build</code> command is the compile part (<code>gcc &lt;project-name&gt;</code>) and using the ./ at the file location runs it.</li> <li>Alternatively, the command <code>cargo run</code> (in terminal) does both in one step simplifying the process. Both ways will print \"Hello COMP423\" in the terminal.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If you would like to save changes simply follow the git basics. The commands below pushes your changes so you can view them on GitHub: <pre><code>git add .\ngit commit -m \"Followed Rust Tutorial and can print a line\"\ngit push -u origin main\n</code></pre> Congratulations you now have a working Dev Container to create a Rust Project in and have now written a program in a modern language!
